# IL-HTE_Educational_Item_Prediction_MIT_URTC_2024

This repo contains scripts for training machine learning models to predict Item-Level Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (IL-HTE) using Logistic Regression, DNN, and CNN.

Each script:
1. Trains and saves a model to models/.
2. Calculates performance metrics (Accuracy, F1, MSE, AUC ROC).
3. Generates feature importance charts (SHAP, Absolute Coefficent Value).
